# Statistical Signal Processing and Inference

This repo hosts the MATLAB code and report for the SSPI coursework. This covers techniques from time-series analysis, machine learning and statistical modelling. Each section includes processing of **real world time-series signals**. 

You can checkout the report [here](01871216_SSPI_Coursework.pdf).

The project comprises of four sections:

### 1. Theory
- Stochastic Processes
- Stationaritity
- Ergodicity
- Estimating Distributions
### 2. Linear Stochastic Modelling
- Auto/Cross correlation
- Autoregressive (AR) modelling
- Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
- <span style="color : blue"><u>Real world signals: ECG recordings</u></span>
### 3. Spectral Estimation
- Periodogram
- Spectrum of AR processes
- Least Squares Estimation of AR coefficients
- **Dial tone signals: Spectogram for time-frequency analysis**
- **Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia detection from ECG**
### 4. Optimal Filtering - Fixed and adaptive
- Wiener Filter
- Least mean square algorithm
- Identification of AR processes
- **Speech recognition**
